# Krishanth (Kris) Suthaharan

I am a third year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. 
I'm interested in computer hardware, electronic circuit designs and robots.
I'm pursuing a minor in Mechatronics and Robotics and Biomedical Engineering.

I am involved with multiple robotics teams and completed multiple technical projects. 
I've been programming and taking on technical work for about 5 years fascinated by troubleshooting complex problems, 
working in team environments and being able to develop technology with lasting impacts on society.

I am an active member on the University of Toronto Robotics for Space Exploration team (RSX) being 
in the organization for about 3 years. I joined RSX in my first year as an electrical team member. 
In my second year, I took on greater responsibilities being the Junior Electrical Lead. And now, I've 
become the Electrical Lead. For the past year, I've also been a member on the University of Toronto Aerospace team and 
more specifically, I worked in the firmware systems division under the Space Systems subteam.
